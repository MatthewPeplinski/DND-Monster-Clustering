This program uses dnd monster stat blocks to determine the number of groups dnd monsters would fall into based purely their base stats, then forms those groups.
Using inertia for KMeans to determine the number of clusters, it was determined that there would be 5 groupings of monsters, which roughly fall in line with wizards of the coast's
own "Tiers of play" philosophy.
